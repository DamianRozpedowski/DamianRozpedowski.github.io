                <p>Pierogi (left) are filled dumplings made by wrapping unleavened dough around a savoury or sweet filling and cooking in boiling water. They are often pan-fried before serving. Typical fillings include potato, cheese, quark, sauerkraut, ground meat, edible mushrooms, and/or fruits. Savoury pierogi are often served with a topping of sour cream, fried onions, or both.</p>

            <h3>Polish Cuisine</h3>
                <p>Polish cuisine (Polish: kuchnia polska) is a style of cooking and food preparation originating in or widely popular in Poland. Polish cuisine has evolved over the centuries to become very eclectic due to Poland's history and it shares many similarities with other regional cuisines. Polish-styled cooking in other cultures is often referred to as à la polonaise.</p>
               
                <p>Polish cuisine is rich in meat, especially pork, chicken and game, in addition to a wide range of vegetables, spices, mushrooms, and herbs. It is also characteristic in its use of various kinds of noodles as well as cereals and grains. In general, Polish cuisine is hearty and heavy in its use of butter, cream, eggs and extensive seasoning. The traditional dishes are often demanding in preparation. Many Poles allow themselves a generous amount of time to serve and enjoy their festive meals, especially Christmas Eve supper (Wigilia) on December 24 or Easter breakfast, which could take a number of days to prepare in their entirety.</p>
                
               <p>Among the well-known Polish national dishes are bigos; pierogi; kiełbasa; pork loin kotlet schabowy breaded cutlet; gołąbki cabbage roll; zrazy roulade; sour cucumber soup (zupa ogórkowa); mushroom soup, (zupa grzybowa); tomato soup (zupa pomidorowa); rosół meat broth; żurek sour rye soup; flaki tripe soup; and red beetroot barszcz.</p>
